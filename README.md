# Linear-Binary-Trinary-Search

In this first assignment you'll be implementing linear, binary, and ternary (aka trinary) search functions. You've likely already implemented these (at least the first two) in a previous class, so it should not be too difficult. However, you are free to use Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to help you out. Regardless of how much code you write, you will be uing ChatGPT (or some other model) to help explain to how these algorithms differ from one another, what the pros/cons of each are, etc.

Note that the file assign1.py has the function signatures defined. In order to successfully complete this assignment you must adhere to these, and infer what the names of variables being returned mean.

Also, be sure to document your code properly by adding docstrings. In addition to documentation, be sure that a reasonable coding style is followed as well (e.g. two blank lines between functions). Your program will not pass the first checks done by the linter if there is not proper documentation and styling.

Lastly, be sure to add your name to the top of the assignment where the placeholder. You will lose points if this is not done (see grading rubric in Canvas).
